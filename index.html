      Don't know what to read next?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Figuring out what to read can be tough, with so many options out there. A quick visit to your <a href="https://www.denverlibrary.org/"> local library</a> or <a href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/"> favorite bookstore down the street</a> can quickly put you in front of thousands of books. Sure, there are staff recommendations and a Popular New Releases section for you to peruse, but why not listen to my opinion instead?
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, I've listed just a few books for you to check out. I've tried to vary the themes of the books to appeal to my very, very broad audience.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Here are just a couple of reasons why you should listen to me:
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> I was an English Lit major </li>
      <li> That's pretty much it </li>
      <li> I spent four years learning to be a professional book-reader, essentially </li>

    <ul id="none">
    <li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0812993543/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1488936454&sr=1-1&keywords=ta-nehisi+coates"> BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME </a> </li>
    <li> Ta-Nehisi Coates' essay to his young black son makes for powerful and challenging reading. The short book only takes a day or two to read but will stay with you for a while. </li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eye-World-Wheel-Time-Book/dp/0812511816/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1488936524&sr=1-1&keywords=the+wheel+of+time"> THE EYE OF THE WORLD </a> </li>
    <li> Looking more for a series of books that will last you for the next decade? Tired of hearing about <i>Game of Thrones</i>? Robert Jordan started writing <i>The Wheel of Time</i> series in 1990 and died before he could complete the saga. A fan of his finished the final book in the series and published it in 2013. It will probably take you just as long to get through all fourteen volumes (I'm still working on it myself.) </li>
    <li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Macbeth-Folger-Shakespeare-Library-William/dp/0743477103/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488937443&sr=8-1&keywords=macbeth"> MACBETH </a> </li>
    <li> Get some culturin'! Shakespeare <i> is </i> all he's cracked up to be. The eerieness and action of this play makes it my favorite of Shakespeare's tragedies. </li>
